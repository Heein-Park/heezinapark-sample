# Welcome to Heez.in Project

>The blog <em>Heez in a park</em> entails two functionalities that are also the goals to achieve. First and foremost, it is an archive that exhibits my essays and 'scribbles.' Scribbles are texts that require sophistication. I record those sketches for future writing.
>
>Not a mere archive that stores texts, but the website "Heez in a park" is a proving ground where I experiment with web design and front-end development skills. So the contents of this website are samples to test typography and scripting methods for more suitable legibility.

Welcome to a code base of Heez.in, which includes components and modules written in Javascript (and other languages if it's possible for me to handle.

For whom wants to visit the blog, please help yourself to get into [my blog](https://heez.in).

Your interests are the best motivation for me to keep on improvement. Thank you.
